1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
  * Server side routing is a way of retrieve the data and necessary to render a web page from a server. Each time a user clicks on a web page, a call is made to the server and returns the entire page, html and all back to the browser to be rendered.  In client side routing the browser saves the necessary data and html to render a page in memory, and calls are made to an api to update data as needed. Instead of a server retrieving pages compiled by the server and refreshing, client side router allows a user to navigate between pages without refreshing the entire site. 
2.  What does HTTP stand for?
  * Hypertext Transfer Protocol
3.  What does CRUD stand for?
  * Create, Read, Update, Delete
4.  Which HTTP methods can be mapped to the CRUD acronym that we use when interfacing with APIs/Servers.
    * C = POST
		* R = GET
		* U = PUT
		* D = DELETE
5.  Mention three tools we can use to make AJAX requests
  * We can use the fetch api, xhr requests, and axios.
